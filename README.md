1. Upgrade Box -> BoxV2
2. Proxy that point to Box
3. Proxen then point to BoxV2

    There is 3 different methods to deploy a proxy
    1. Deploy a Proxy manually (Not doing it)
    2. Using hardhat-deploy built-in proxies (The one we are doing now)
    3. Using Openzeppelin upgrades plugin (Examples visible here: https://github.com/PatrickAlphaC/hardhat-upgrades-fcc/tree/main/scripts/otherUpgradeExamples)
